In 1.17, "τζαι πιένουν μες αρά" has a different syntax than Greek. In greek the sentence corresponds to: "Και μας πιάνουν ζωντανούς." where the object "μας" (us) is positioned before the verb while in Pharasiot the object is positioned after the verb. (source: Andriotis)[It is matches also the 6.1.3 from Prokopidis since the nominal complements are after the verb which they define]

3.12 again example where the object (pronoun) is positioned after the verb. Greek example: "Και τον άρπαξε από τον λαιμό να τον πνιξει" (where the greek "τον" is the Pharasiot "τα" and the greek "ton" is the Pharasiot "τει" 

In 3.5 the peculiar syntax with the "κι" is not found in Greek. This ki functions as a weak that even though there exists already a that in the sentence. More on that phenomenon can be found inside the term paper in the Language Structure-Syntax section. The syntax in greek would be: "Είπε ότι:"

In pharasiot the verb "tell" gets an object in accusative. In greek "tell" gets an object in genitive. For example greek: "Πές μου, να δούμε τι θα μου πείς" corresponds to the syntax in 3.18.
