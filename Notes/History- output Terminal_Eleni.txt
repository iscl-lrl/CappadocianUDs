The following 43 relations are currently permitted in language [el]:
acl, acl:relcl, advcl, advmod, amod, appos, aux, case, cc, ccomp, clf, compound, conj, cop, csubj, csubj:pass, dep, det, discourse, dislocated, expl, fixed, flat, goeswith, iobj, list, mark, nmod, nsubj, nsubj:outer, nsubj:pass, nummod, obj, obl, obl:agent, obl:arg, orphan, parataxis, punct, reparandum, root, vocative, xcomp
If a language needs a relation subtype that is not documented in the universal guidelines, the relation
must have a language-specific documentation page in a prescribed format.
See https://universaldependencies.org/contributing_language_specific.html for further guidelines.
Documented dependency relations can be specifically turned on/off for each language in which they are used.
See https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/udvalidator/cgi-bin/unidep/langspec/specify_deprel.pl for details.
