Notes: Generally, it was a little faster than annotating the sentences manually. The reason was that adding the features and the other columns on one's own takes a lot of time
    1. when the word is non-greek or a non usual form of Greek the parser gave wrong POS always.
    2. The parser could not identify all the words that should be splitted. For example it had no problem with στον but could not work with σο. 
    3. No use of the parataxis relationship while we use it.
